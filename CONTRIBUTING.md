# Contributing to Pond

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pond! We appreciate that you've taken the time to consider helping improve this project.

## Current Status

**We are not currently accepting external contributions.** Pond is in its early development phase, and we're focusing on establishing the core architecture, design patterns, and foundational features before opening it up to community contributions.

## Why Not Right Now?

- **Rapid Development**: The project is evolving quickly with frequent breaking changes
- **Architecture Decisions**: We're still making fundamental decisions about the project's structure
- **Documentation**: Our contributor guidelines and development processes are not yet finalized
- **Review Capacity**: We don't currently have the bandwidth to properly review and integrate external contributions

## Future Plans

We absolutely plan to welcome community contributions once Pond matures! We expect this to happen when:

- The core API and architecture stabilize
- We have comprehensive documentation for contributors
- We establish clear coding standards and review processes
- We have adequate maintainer capacity to support contributors
